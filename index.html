                            I had the pleasure of working closely with Seva during the launch of Miro AI. His exceptional technical architecture skills were instrumental in the success of the project. Seva consistently demonstrated outstanding acumen in making critical trade-off decisions, ensuring the AI platform was robust for production use cases. His collaborative approach with all functions greatly enhanced the team's cohesion and we were able to ship a basket of compelling experiences in a very short amount of time. Seva is an invaluable asset to any team, and I highly recommend him for his expertise and dedication.

He has shown the ability to work in numerous team frameworks and is been always able to push the limits of the group. He is self-motivated and requires no supervision. You can rest assure what should be delivered will be delivered. When you start recruiting for your project team, you start the roster with people like Seva and you know you can sail any weather.

He was responsible for the development of an internal tool that was used by thousands of employees later, and he did it very well! He advocated for code quality, as well as for meeting business needs, which made the application he worked on very popular and we received tons of good feedback on it. Vsevolod helped to introduce the best development practices and modern technologies - he is always on top of things and knows what technologies/practices are available and what'd be the best for a project. All of this was done in a very friendly and positive atmosphere, which helped the team to stay happy and achieve all goals even when deadlines were really tough. Communication with Vsevolod is also easy, he always goes straight to the point without playing any games. I really enjoyed working with Vsevolod.
